# Pharos Auto Faucet
Pharos Auto Faucet is a Python-based automation script designed to streamline the process of claiming testnet tokens from the Pharos Testnet faucet, performing daily check-ins, and transferring PHRS balances to a main wallet. Tailored for developers and testers on the Pharos Testnet, this tool supports multiple wallets, proxy rotation for anonymity, and a rich console interface with color-coded logs and tables for enhanced user experience. It includes robust error handling to ensure reliable operation across various network conditions.

## üöÄ Key Features
‚ú® Multi-Wallet Support: Processes multiple wallets from pvkey.txt for faucet claims and check-ins.
‚ú® Daily Check-In Automation: Automatically performs daily check-ins to earn additional rewards.
‚ú® PHRS Balance Transfer: Transfers all PHRS balances to a main wallet specified in receiver.txt.
‚ú® Proxy Rotation: Rotates proxies from proxy.txt to prevent IP-based restrictions.
‚ú® Rich Console UI: Displays progress with vibrant tables, panels, and emojis using the rich library.
‚ú® Robust Error Handling: Includes retry mechanisms and detailed logging for failed operations.
‚ú® Configurable File Inputs: Supports custom private key, proxy, and receiver address files.
üõ†Ô∏è Use Case
This script is ideal for developers and testers who need to claim PHRS testnet tokens, perform daily check-ins, and consolidate balances for testing smart contracts, dApps, or other blockchain projects on the Pharos Testnet. It eliminates manual interactions with the faucet and check-in system, saving time and ensuring efficient token management across multiple wallets.

## Requirements
‚öôÔ∏è Python 3.8+
‚öôÔ∏è Required libraries: web3, eth-account, requests, fake-useragent, rich
‚öôÔ∏è List of private keys (pvkey.txt)
‚öôÔ∏è Main wallet address (receiver.txt)
‚öôÔ∏è Proxy list (proxy.txt, optional)
üì¶ Installation

## Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pharos-auto-faucet.git
cd pharos-auto-faucet
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install web3 eth-account requests fake-useragent rich
```

## Configure the script:
- Prepare pvkey.txt with private keys (one per line, without 0x prefix).
- Add the main wallet address to receiver.txt (single Ethereum address, with or without 0x).
- Optionally, add proxies to proxy.txt (format: http://user:pass@host:port).
- I recommend using proxies from DATAIMPULSE for affordable and budget-friendly prices (just $5 for 5GB proxy data).

## Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## The script will:
- Load private keys, receiver address, and proxies.
- Claim PHRS tokens from the Pharos Testnet faucet for each wallet.
- Perform daily check-ins for additional rewards.
- Transfer all PHRS balances to the main wallet specified in receiver.txt.
- Display progress with a rich console interface, including tables and color-coded logs.


## Configuration

Edit the following variables in the script to customize behavior:

NETWORK_CONFIG: Network details (e.g., RPC URL, chain ID).
pvkey.txt: List of private keys for wallets.
receiver.txt: Main wallet address for PHRS transfers.
proxy.txt: List of proxies for rotation (optional).

## üìù Notes
- Ensure pvkey.txt contains valid private keys without 0x prefixes.
- Verify the receiver address in receiver.txt is correct to prevent loss of funds.
- Proxies are recommended to avoid faucet rate limits, but the script works in direct mode if proxy.txt is absent.
- The script assumes a stable internet connection for Web3 and API interactions.
- Always back up private keys and test the script with small amounts first.
